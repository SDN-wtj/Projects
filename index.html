<h1>My Projects</h1>

<p>I have created a couple of projects on code.org and on VS Code.</p>

<p>#1 I created this game in one of my classes and is a very famous game. It is the <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/KII9-ZXD5zTDT6O1DpHk8gtK_SdbdevInBw2v9Ss650">chrome dinosaur game!</a> By the way those buttons in the top left corner are soon to be updated as buttons to change dark or light mode</p>
<p>#2 Another Project for my classes, I made a <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/d3lRfHK5UnNQunaMU1ZqbMkU5AGzueiPyTMgrQovdOU">solo-player online air hockey game</a></p>
<p>#3 Also a project for my classes I created this <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/woNsZURclgewcfZVhCgDfNFlvKh7j0AyRRXUkQzW1X4">balloon shooting game</a> but made it my own in many ways</p>
<p>#4 I made this real quick (took me about a minute so not so great...) because I was bored so yeah here it is: <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/woNsZURclgewcfZVhCgDfNFlvKh7j0AyRRXUkQzW1X4"> Racing Game </a> </p>
<p>#5 I made this for one of my classes and it is practically <a href="https://sdn-wtj.github.io/Angry-Birds-Basic/">angry birds without the slingshot</a></p>
<p>#6 If you liked #5 you are bound to love <a href="https://sdn-wtj.github.io/Angry-Bird-with-a-bo-staff/">number 6</a>(but you know you aren't under my control so yeah )</p>

<h3> That is Practically it people though I have more I think this is  good enough
